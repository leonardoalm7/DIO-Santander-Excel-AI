# Financial Investment Simulator  

**Project from Bootcamp Santander - Excel with Artificial Intelligence**  
*Course taught on [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/)*  

## üìå Overview  
This Excel-based financial simulator helps users project long-term investment growth based on monthly contributions, expected returns, and risk profiles (Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive). It also suggests asset allocation for Real Estate Investment Funds (FIIs) according to the selected profile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
- **Salary-Based Investment Suggestion**: Recommends investing 30% of the entered salary.  
- **Future Value Projections**: Calculates accumulated wealth and monthly dividends over 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30 years.  
- **Customizable Inputs**:  
  - Monthly investment amount (`Quanto investir por m√™s?`).  
  - Investment duration (`Por Quantos Anos?`).  
  - Expected monthly return (`Taxa de Rendimento mensal?`).  
- **Risk Profile Allocation**:  
  - Automatically suggests FII portfolio distribution (PAPEL, TIJOLO, H√çBRIDOS, etc.) based on the selected profile (Moderate by default).

## üìä How It Works  
### 1. **Configuration Tab (`Simulacao`)**  
- Enter your **salary** (e.g., R$10,000) to see the suggested investment (30%).  
- Adjust the **monthly investment**, **duration**, and **expected return rate** in the `INVESTIMENTO MENSAL` section.  
- View projected wealth (`Patrim√¥nio acumulado`) and dividends (`Dividendos Mensais`) in the results table.  

### 2. **FII Allocation**  
- The tool uses a **Database** sheet to fetch recommended FII allocations (% per type) based on your risk profile.  
- Example: A "Moderate" profile allocates 32% to PAPEL, 35% to TIJOLO, etc.

## üîç Key Formulas  
- **Future Value (FV)**: `=FV(taxa_mensal, qtd_anos*12, aporte*-1)`  
- **Dividends Calculation**: `=patrimonio*rendimento_carteira`  
- **Dynamic FII Allocation**: Uses `VLOOKUP` to match risk profiles with predefined % allocations.
